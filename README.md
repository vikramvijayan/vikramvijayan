## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Vikram. 

- âš¡ The code here is meant to highlight a few of the projects I have led. It isn't up-to-date and is from circa 2020. All code was written by me.
  - Older code is typically in MATLAB. Newer code is typically in PYTHON. I have past experience with many other languages [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vikram-vijayan/)
- âš¡ The projects here are related to understanding fundamental principles of brains using the fruit fly model organism. [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06271-6) [Science Advances](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abn3852)
- âš¡ Feel free to contact me for newer versions of this code.
- âš¡ Other projects that I have led that are not on my Github, include:
  - Bioinformatics pipelines to analyze RNA methylation seq datasets. **(PYTHON)** [manuscript in prep]
  - Connectomics pipelines to analyze all the neuronal connections in the fruit fly brain. **(PYTHON)** [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06271-6)
  - Bioinformatics pipelines to analyze RNA seq, ChIP seq, and microarray datasets. This includes data processing, transcript identification, data analysis/visualization, and more. **(MATLAB)** [Genome Biology](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gb-2011-12-5-r47) [PNAS](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0912673106) [J Bacteriology](https://journals.asm.org/doi/full/10.1128/jb.02012-12)
  - Simulation pipelines to model biological pathways within cells. **(MATLAB)** [ACC](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1470672)
