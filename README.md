## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Vikram. 

- âš¡ The code here is old, circa 2020, and is meant to simply highlight a few of the projects I have led. All the code written by me. My older code is typically in MATLAB. Newer code typically in PYTHON.
- âš¡ These projects are related to understanding fundamental principles of brains using the fruit fly model organism.
- âš¡ Feel free to contact me for newer versions of this code.
- âš¡ Other projects that I have led that are not on my Github, include:
  - Bioinformatics pipelines to analyze RNA methylation seq datasets. **(PYTHON)**
  - Connectomics pipelines to analyze all the neuronal connections in the fruit fly brain. **(PYTHON)**
  - Bioinformatics pipelines for analysis of RNA seq, ChIP seq, and microarray datasets. This includes data processing, transcript identification, data analysis/visualization, and more. **(MATLAB)**
  - Simulation pipelines to model biological pathways within cells. **(MATLAB)**
